# Dog Classification Project from Udacity

The project from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Programme deploys the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in PyTorch to classify dog breeds.

- PyTorch
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Data augmentation
- OpenCV pre-trained face detectors (haarcascades & lbpcascade)
- Pre-trained VGG-16 convolutional network
- Transfer Learning ( Resnet50, Densenet161)

# How to use
Open dog_app.ipynb on a jupyter notebook environment, or Google colab. All the detailed information is given inside the notebook.

# Results:
1. When used simple layer structure, the accuracy showed only 14%
2. When used with Resnet-50 as transfer learning, the accuracy increased rapidly and reached to 83%
3. The best result has reached with densenet-161 so far - with the accuracy of 88%
