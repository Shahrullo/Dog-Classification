# Dog Classification Project from Udacity

The project from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Programme deploys the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in PyTorch to classify dog breeds.

- PyTorch
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Data augmentation
- OpenCV pre-trained face detectors (haarcascades & lbpcascade)
- Pre-trained VGG-16 convolutional network
- Transfer Learning ( Resnet50, Densenet161)


# How to use
Open dog_app.ipynb on a jupyter notebook environment, or Google colab. All the detailed information is given inside the notebook.
